# Word Frequency Histogram

This project is a Next.js application that fetches contents of a text file from [https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt](https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt), parses content to find frequency of occurrence of each word, and plots a histogram on frontend using Next.js and React Chart.js 2 library.

## Demo ‚úàÔ∏è

A live demo of application can be found at [https://word-frequency-histogram-omega.vercel.app/](https://word-frequency-histogram-omega.vercel.app/).

## Features

- On first load, application displays a **Get Data** button.
- Pressing **Enter** or clicking on **Get Data** button triggers a fetch request to retrieve text content from **https://www.terriblytinytales.com/test.txt**.
- text content is then parsed, and frequency of occurrence of **each word, regardless of case,** is calculated.
- Before counting frequency, any punctuation marks including ., ,, !, ?, ;, :, (, ), ", ', and - are **removed** from each word.
-  **Top 20** words with **highest occurrence frequency** are displayed in a ***histogram***.
- X-axis represents top 20 words, and Y-axis represents number of times each word occurred in file. histogram is generated using React Chart.js 2 library.
